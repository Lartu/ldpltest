DATA:
a is number
b is number
c is number
d is number

PROCEDURE:
store 912847.123 in a
store 9875 in b
store 0.1239 in c
store -12.989 in d
display a " "  b " " c " " d crlf
in a solve a + a
in b solve b * c
in a solve a - b
in d solve b / d
display a " "  b " " c " " d crlf
modulo a by 678 in a
floor b
floor c
in c solve c + 1
if d is less than 0 then
    in d solve -1 * d
end if
display a " "  b " " c " " d crlf
in a solve (a + b + c + d) / (- ( - a - b - c - d))
display a " "  b " " c " " d crlf
while a is less than 100 do
    in a solve a + 1
repeat
in a solve a - 1
in a solve a - 1
display a crlf
