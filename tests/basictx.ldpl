The STORE QUOTE IN statement allows you to store multiple lines
in a single TEXT variable. Between the STORE QUOTE IN and END QUOTE
statements whitespace is preserved literally, escape codes like \t and
\033[33mwork the same as they do in regular text variables\033[0m (and can themselves
be escaped using \\), and double quotes (") don't need to be escaped.
